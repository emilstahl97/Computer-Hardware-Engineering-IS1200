# Computer-Hardware-Engineering-IS1200

## Content and learning outcomes

### Course contents

The course gives fundamental knowledge of computer organization, both from a hardware and software perspective. The course is organized in six modules that include, among other things, the following concepts and terms:

C and Assembly Programming: pointers, functions, stack, assembly language, machine language, instruction coding, and processor registers.
Input/Output Systems: timers, interrupts, and memory mapped input/output.
Digital Design: truth tables, gates, Boolean algebra, multiplexer, decoder, adder, combinational logic, sequential logic, and registers.
Processor Design: arithmetic logic unit, datapath, control unit, and pipeline.
Memory Hierarchy: instruction cache, data cache, and virtual memory.
Parallel Processors and Programs: Amdahlâ€™s law, various kinds of parallelism, and multicore.
Note that module 3 is recommended prerequisites for the course and will not be covered in lectures or laboratory exercises. However, the course material for module 3 will be available on the course web page because the knowledge of this module is prerequisite for module 4.

### Intended learning outcomes

After the course, the student will be able to:

Implement low-level programs in the C programing language and in an assembly language.
Analyze processor microarchitectures, with and without a pipeline.
Explain the principles of memory hierarchies, including cache structures.
Implement low-level programs with input-output, timers, and interrupts.
Explain the principles of multiprocessor computers and how they can be programmed.
Explain and describe technical solutions, both orally and in writing.
